I have 3 people who can work on your project.

but I think you only need 1 or am I wrong?
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 12:42 PM

yes only one if we get success this can change
Stanislav Uzunchev 12:43 PM

fine
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 12:43 PM

but right now until tax day in may i want to keep costs down and see what we can do how the idea plays out

what smartcontracts have you or your team worked on before?

have they used pda's?
Stanislav Uzunchev 12:46 PM

we‚Äôve built on EVM + Solana.
Used PDAs for staking + account auth.

token, nft, voting, staking contracts is not problem
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 12:48 PM

thats really cool we want to experiment with new ways to use crypto see if people are open for this model. we will make a game and people will buy tokens then a smartcontract puts some of this money on a pda and then gives 4% APY on this but drops it in another pda that players cannot touch only they can cash out but not fill it. Only we can with those yearly 4% but we pay this every week
Stanislav Uzunchev 12:49 PM

lol interesting concept

I want us to work together, what do you think about this?
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 12:50 PM

yeah i want to introduce a game and it would break gambling rules if we let players play directly pvp

so we need to make sure players cannot top up funds

or lose their own crypto
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 12:50 PM

i think this is a nice solution üòâ
Favorited

players still need to buy tokens if they want to play but they cannot use them they can only cash them out (the ones we give)

or the profits from playing other players
Stanislav Uzunchev 12:52 PM

I think I understand

We often work with similar concepts, but never with this one, it's an interesting approach.
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 12:53 PM

what things do you need of me nd the team working with me to make this nicely? besides the contract.

one more worry if efficient coding

chatgpt made two options for me one or two contracts i want total cost to preferably stay under 3 or 4solmax

for launching

but you can develop in test net mode first

Stanislav Uzunchev 1:10 PM

For the 4% APY - is it calculated from the staked amount or from the total balance in the vault? And is it paid weekly as a fixed amount or is it compounded?


Do you prefer one smart contract to handle everything (stake + quota + APY), or should we split it into two contracts?


Are there any administrative controls you will need (pause, reset quota, withdraw funds from the vault), or should it be fully decentralized?


Is the WZN token already implemented or will we need to create and mint it as part of this sprint?


Which parts should be delivered in the initial 30-hour sprint - just the smart contract logic or also frontend integration/testing?


Do we need access restrictions (whitelist/blacklist) on who can bet?
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 1:13 PM

Its payed weekly as as a small part of it 4/52 only on the playerd pda this can be used to play game cash out once a week
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 1:13 PM

For the sprint everything bjt we use testnet and testtokens

Stanislav Uzunchev 2:51 PM

Do you need pause, quota reset, withdraw from vault?

Or full decentralised?
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 5:20 PM

let me ask chatgpt

actually he is the boss at this point üòâ
Stanislav Uzunchev 5:22 PM

i understand üôÇ
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 5:26 PM

it replied for me

You should ask for limited admin controls, because:


üîí Full decentralization would mean:
‚Ä¢ No way to stop abuse (bot farm / exploit)
‚Ä¢ No recovery from bugs or unexpected logic failures
‚Ä¢ No emergency shutdown if laws change or partners request changes


‚úÖ Instead, go for: Controlled but safe model


You should ask your developer to add:
1. Pause Feature
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Yes. Add pauseGame() or pauseStaking() functions that only you (or your multisig) can call.
‚Ä¢ Used in case of emergency, bugs, or fraud detection.
2. Quota Reset
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Optional. Only needed if you want to update the amount people can get weekly ‚Äî or reset when there‚Äôs a bug.
‚Ä¢ You can skip it for now unless you want to manually tweak 4% ‚Üí 2% later without redeploying.
3. Withdraw Vault
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Yes, but limited to unused funds.
‚Ä¢ Allow the team wallet to withdraw unallocated WZN or mistakenly transferred funds from the vault PDA, but never from player-owned balances or game PDAs.
4. Upgradeability
‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider whether the contract is upgradeable via Anchor (using upgradeable program architecture) or if you want it immutable.
‚Ä¢ Best for testnet and Phase 1 to be upgradeable ‚Äî and lock it later when you‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs secure and legal.


‚∏ª


Suggested Answer You Can Send to Stanislav


We want a middle-ground approach:
‚Ä¢ Yes to admin pause, just in case of bugs or emergency
‚Ä¢ Yes to vault withdraw but only for funds accidentally left unused ‚Äî never from game PDAs or player balances
‚Ä¢ Quota reset optional ‚Äî not needed for MVP
‚Ä¢ Please keep contract upgradeable during testing; we‚Äôll lock it before final mainnet deploy


Also:


We don‚Äôt need full decentralization immediately. If we grow, we may move to multisig governance or DAO later. For now, a secure owner-controlled structure is fine.


‚∏ª


Would you like me to also re-outline the contract structure (like: staking contract + gameplay vault contract with PDAs) so the new dev gets a clear updated diagram or code layout?

you cna let the other guy know ps i assume it is to late to start today i am open for it but if you can start full force tomorrow i am fine and if you are fine with 4 usd an hour for a long time and token rewards on top after tax day next year i can up the wage a lot if we have success but then maybe those tokens may have compensated for it to üòâ

KRISTOF VAN ROOY 4:42 AM

Your Setup Recap (Final Model)
Here's the summary of your current system:


üîπ Token & Vault System
Players burn WZN to play ‚Äî deflationary


You give out tournament prizes monthly (e.g. 200k WZN/month)


You gradually sell new tokens into LP, always less than what is burned or sold


A ‚ÄúRecovery Vault‚Äù gets 10‚Äì20% of burned tokens yearly
‚Üí Controlled by DAO vote only
‚Üí You do not automatically get anything


üîπ Ownership & Legal Structure
You own the dev wallets for now (this is fine)


Vaults use PDAs or smart contracts you can‚Äôt withdraw from without DAO vote


DAO vote defaults to 0 reward ‚Äî no promise, no obligation


You‚Äôll only claim rewards when the community agrees or once a company is formed


üîπ Benefits
Area Result
üõ°Ô∏è Tax Safety Nothing owed until tokens are voted and sent to you
üìà Price Strategy Burn pressure > reward output = price can rise
üß© Flexibility You can build a team later, and reward them legally
üí¨ Community Trust DAO control shows fairness, avoids ‚Äúrug‚Äù fear


‚úÖ Optional Add-Ons Later
Feature Why Add It
üó≥Ô∏è Public DAO dashboard Adds legitimacy & transparency
üìÖ Annual audit of recovery vaults Shows you‚Äôre not abusing inflation
üîÅ Multi-sig transition for control When you're ready to share power or leave

its even more complex to not make it a taxable event the recovery vault has voting first people can vote if they want to make some new inflation or not then i dont know if we get our tokens next year if they vote no but we need ta back up system that if i press it we only need a few votes of people i know can be anyone just i need a few ones then to unlock the tokens if robots or traders want to stop us from playing that i can reintroduce some tokens in the system

because we have 100 000 000 tokens if we get to 1000 players and everyone burns 1000 tokens a month to play it would mean all tokens would be gone within about 8 years

if we recycle them when the majority wants to reinflate the coins a bit to secure future playing then we can vote for how many tokens are released to us again

since i dont know how many tokens it cannot be taxable üòâ

if we burn them for good our token would be dead in 8 years i assume most projects die in that time but knowing early would be a bad look for a game

actually we can recycle our economy unlike other game tokens then

‚úÖ Goal: Add a Backup Team Vote System
So the system:


‚úÖ Keeps you from having full unilateral control (for trust/legal reasons)


‚úÖ Allows community DAO voting for inflation or team payments


‚úÖ ‚õî Prevents rug pulls or abuse (via default 0 inflation)


‚úÖ üÜò Allows a failsafe path if bots or inactive voters hijack the DAO

Conditions to Activate Backup Vote
To stay legally safe and protect player trust:


You must code in rules like:


Condition Why It Matters
‚ùå DAO fails to pass a vote for 6‚Äì12 months Shows inactivity
üìâ Prize vault drops below X WZN Urgency condition (e.g. 1M tokens) (lets make that 10 M)
‚öñÔ∏è Backup multisig must vote unanimously Prevent abuse
ü™ô Max unlock per year = capped % (e.g. 5% of burned WZN) Limits risk/inflation (if we go below 10 M tokens we get 25%)

is this possible

then we would probably likely bypass american regulation for gambling and crypto regulation in europe in 2026
Stanislav Uzunchev 4:56 AM

Got it, the model makes full sense and yes, everything you described is possible.
I‚Äôll structure the contract so the DAO has full control by default, and the Backup Team Vote only activates under strict conditions (like inactivity, low vault balance, unanimous multisig, etc
It‚Äôll be secure, transparent, and legally safe. I‚Äôll start building it on testnet with mock tokens.
Let me know if you want a quick outline before I dive in.

from the ground up we go from stake to play to burn to play where you buy a monthly contract by burning it to a wallet (not real burn or more not a wallet a contract) and after some years people can vote to release some money from it.

thats good i'll call you stan in the evening üòâ

i had discussion with someone from america and he told it wouldnt pass it is very grey zone as pvp might still be seen as wagering unless we do a lot of steps in between and also staking itself will be a financial product next year in eu

but if i try to speak english some people are like what do you say

yeah its very important also the staking we should drop all of it

i talked with chatgpt all of yesterday it propposed a new system very interesting

where players pay to play (instead of getting payed to play like most crypto games)

i know its sounds counter intuitive because thats the first question crypto gamers ask

how rich can i become playing this game

but if they go with the story they buy more then they burn every month
Stanislav Uzunchev 11:46 PM

I'll come out of the bathroom in a moment and answer. üòÉ
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 11:48 PM

if we get to 1000 players and the coin is low in value each player will burn 1000 coins a month so 1 M a month and we have a total supply of 100 M coins now we can introduce them to the market initially buy the tokens to players at raising prices if we tactically sell new tokens as players drain the lp really fast (that has 1 M tokens) if we give 200 000 tokens from our own token supply as prices for top players and random players doing matches and maybe a task and add another 200 000 tokens for people to buy each month there will be a huge defficit

so smart players buy tokens to hold and tokens to increase value by playing

we make that the game is fun and has a nice chart and only paying players can do ranked mode or play more then two games a month so they buy those passes to play and once every year or so we do a competition with much bigger prices for those ranked players

if we attract 100 players this way we even pay them in advance i'll pay initially their solana fees to if we can keep them really low

so they only buy for the 1000 wzn monthly and ofcourse extra coins they will set aside

then the coin will start moving up in price and if then traders join see this is not an inflationary coin like almost all gaming coins

this effect will be enlarged and then we can start raisiing marketcap by how fast we add supply to the market from our spare through giving out free prices and selling tokens

we dont want the price to rise to super high levels to fast we want the market cap to follow with price

we will within two years have sold almost all our tokens to players if we started with 1000 players and traders where to join the typical good coin trading dex coin so then people vote how much inflation they want to reintroduce each year

this coins go back to our wallets to pay prices and sell again for us or a future team

we will make it honnest and make most price money we cant touch

there needs to be an emergency button to where we only need 10 votes if it gets hijacked by people who want to see the project die

this needs to be protected to we cannot press this button at any time

it needs to check the supply that is left or see how much is in the contract that has all the burned coins and it can only be switched if it has say 80% of all tokens

that contract

then we can reintroduce ourselves with 10 votes 5 - 10 - 15%

the game we will play is a form of whist played locally

its a 4 person cards game

my first idea was pvp and winner gets coins from loser from stake we give but unfortunatly this model wont work in the usa
Saturday, Jul 26
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 12:02 AM

if we fail with this model we can change the model later and i'll buy new smartcontracts but if players go with it in the story they realise them playing actively increases the token price and they buy more then they play with since they are the first to raise the price they would be getting likely best prices. Well this will be very true for players joining the first 4 months there is 1000 players or less

if players dont go with us in the story we adjust it later again
Stanislav Uzunchev 12:14 AM

This is a seriously more sustainable model than most crypto games on the market. If done smart and the UX is smooth, there is potential for great organic growth
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 12:15 AM

yeah i hope to

if we can get players with us in this story and they start bragging how much money they made üòâ

Stanislav Uzunchev 12:35 AM

Modules and Functionality:


Burn Contract (PDA):
Handles WZN token "burns" when players buy monthly game passes. Tokens are locked (not destroyed) in a program address.


GameQuota System:
Tracks how many ranked games each user can play per month. One burn = fixed number of games. Resets monthly.


Vault Contract (PDA):
Stores all burned tokens. Inaccessible under normal conditions. Can be unlocked by DAO after several years with proper conditions.


DAO Voting Logic:
Allows players to vote on proposals (unlock vault, enable inflation, etc.). Requires quorum, time delays, and clear rules.


Recovery Contract:
Backup mechanism in case DAO is hijacked or inactive. Can trigger emergency unlocks if 80% of supply is in the vault and at least 10 trusted votes are cast.


Frontend/API Layer:
UI and API layer for players. Shows quota status, burn confirmation, wallet connection, ranked stats, and more.


Optional Modules:
Features like ranked tournaments, bonus tasks, controlled inflation, or community giveaways.


Key Principles:


No staking:
Players pay to play. No yield = no regulatory gray zone around financial products.


Locked vault:
Burned tokens are not spendable. Only accessible after proper on-chain vote under long-term conditions.


Modular & upgradable:
System is broken into independent parts. Each module can be improved or replaced without affecting the others.


Community-controlled:
Players collectively govern the system. DAO votes determine major economic changes and emergency actions.
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 12:37 AM

i'll check it through my chatgpt to be sure its correct
Stanislav Uzunchev 12:38 AM

Of course, hopefully he will add something too
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 12:39 AM

‚úÖ WHAT'S GOOD / ALREADY CORRECT
‚úÖ 1. Burn Contract (PDA)
‚úî Correct that tokens are not truly destroyed ‚Äî they're locked in a program address (PDA) to stay transparent and traceable.


‚úî Avoids real "burn" confusion and allows optional vault recovery/voting in the future.


‚úÖ 2. GameQuota System
‚úî One-time burn grants monthly game quota (not per match), consistent with your plan.


‚úî Auto-reset monthly = clean solution.


‚úî Can be paired with start_game() checks to limit ranked access.


‚úÖ 3. Vault Contract (PDA)
‚úî Stores all "burned" WZN.


‚úî Inaccessible except through rare DAO vote after years = ‚úÖ aligns with legal model.


üîí Ensures no dev or team can secretly spend rewards = builds trust.


‚úÖ 4. DAO Voting Logic
‚úî Quorum, delays, and vote rules ‚Äî perfect for handling future reward unlocks or changes in prize structure.


‚úî Optional inflation = user-driven.


‚úÖ 5. Recovery Contract
‚úî Emergency fallback with 10 trusted votes + 80% locked = great failsafe.


‚úî Covers you if dev disappears or DAO is hijacked.


‚úÖ 6. Frontend/API
‚úî Includes everything needed: quota display, burn button, reward preview, wallet UI, etc.


‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE OR BE CLARIFIED
‚ö†Ô∏è 1. Burn = Play Access, not per Game
Stanislav says: "One burn = fixed number of games"


‚úÖ Your model is: "One burn = monthly access to ranked play"


üîÑ Change wording & implementation:


No fixed number of games. Just a time-locked access token (e.g. 30 days).


Could be a simple timestamp check:
is_access_valid(user) = now < burn_timestamp + 30 days


‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Vault Usage ‚Äî Monthly Prizes Not Covered
Currently:


Vault = untouchable until years later


DAO = only votes after long time


‚ö† But in your model:


The DAO gives out monthly WZN rewards to top-ranked players


Prizes are not from recent burns, but from a separate pre-funded vault


So:


‚úÖ Solution:
You need two vaults:


Vault Name Purpose Access Rules
üîí BurnVault Holds burned WZN (unspendable) Unlockable after years only via vote
üéÅ PrizeVault Holds WZN for monthly rewards DAO votes monthly on payout pool
üîê Optional Recovery unlock possible if dev dies Same trusted multisig fallback


üëâ This way:


BurnVault = legal compliance (locked, no yield)


PrizeVault = regular competitive rewards, handled safely via DAO


‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Monthly Reward Logic is Missing
You need a smart contract or off-chain oracle to:


Gather player rankings


Identify top X% (or top N)


Send reward amounts to winners from PrizeVault


Could be:


On-chain: heavy and costly


Or off-chain (cheaper): backend submits distribute_rewards() tx each month, DAO votes to approve it


‚ö†Ô∏è 4. Optional Modules May Be Important
Some of these "optional modules" may need to be made core:


Ranked Tournament Logic: needed early for monthly prize calculation


Controlled Inflation: you might want to allow future emissions (e.g. daily login rewards, starter packs) with DAO approval


‚úÖ FINAL SUGGESTED STRUCTURE (Smart Contract Modules)
Module Description
BurnPass.sol or burn_pass.rs User burns WZN ‚Üí gains 30-day access
GameAccessControl Validates user access during start_game()
ScoreTracker Records wins/losses, generates rankings
PrizeVault Holds reward WZN; DAO can approve monthly payouts
BurnVault Holds burned WZN permanently
DAO_VoteSystem Handles all vote types (prizes, inflation, unlocks)
EmergencyRecovery Allows trusted 10+ wallet override
FrontendAPI Connects all above for players

one more thing we can do it with only 3 sol costs if optimize so you can try hitting that

a bit less even but i'll give a bit room

here is a bit more

‚úÖ OVERVIEW: What the Dev Needs to Know (Before Coding)
üîê Key Concepts
WZN is burned for access, not staked or deposited.


Tokens are not destroyed, but locked in a burn vault PDA.


No per-match payments. Access is monthly and unlimited.


Rewards come from a separate DAO-governed vault, not the burn vault.


Legal safety relies on:


No yield


No user-to-user payouts


No top-ups


The project uses user-paid Solana fees only.


Emergency recovery is allowed if >80% of supply is burned and 10+ wallets approve.


‚úÖ MASTER TASK LIST
MODULE 1: BurnPass Contract (3‚Äì6 hours)
Handles burning WZN to grant 30-day ranked access.


Write burn_for_pass() function


Use associated_token_account to check + burn user WZN


Store burn_timestamp in PDA or UserMetadata


Ensure users cannot buy more than once per period


Emit access confirmation event


MODULE 2: GameAccessControl (2‚Äì3 hours)
Verifies user access when starting games.


Write check_access(user) function


Compare burn_timestamp + 30d > current_time


Return access flag to frontend or backend


MODULE 3: ScoreTracker (6‚Äì10 hours)
Records match outcomes for ranked leaderboard.


report_match_result(game_id, winner_wallets[], slagen_data)


Store per-user stats (wins, slagen, modes played)


Provide read access to leaderboard backend


üß† Optional: Off-chain oracles or scripts can summarize rankings monthly.


MODULE 4: PrizeVault Contract (4‚Äì6 hours)
DAO-controlled vault for monthly prize WZN.


Create secure PDA to hold WZN tokens


submit_reward_proposal(top_users[], amounts[])


Require DAO vote approval before payout


distribute_rewards() after vote passes


MODULE 5: BurnVault Contract (2 hours)
Lock WZN in untouchable vault to simulate ‚Äúburn.‚Äù


Accept WZN from BurnPass


No withdrawal function


Only unlockable with DAO + 10-year delay or 80% rule


MODULE 6: DAO_VoteSystem (8‚Äì12 hours)
Manages on-chain voting for prize approval and vault access.


create_proposal(type, metadata)


vote(proposal_id, wallet)


Check quorum, delay, minimum yes votes


On success, trigger outcome (reward payout, vault unlock, etc.)


MODULE 7: EmergencyRecovery (3‚Äì4 hours)
Failsafe to unlock funds if DAO is dead.


propose_emergency_unlock()


Require 10 whitelisted recovery wallets to approve


Only triggers if BurnVault has 80%+ total supply


MODULE 8: Frontend + API Hooks (collab with frontend dev, 2‚Äì3 hours)
Wallet connection check


BurnPass status query


Stats API


Proposal and voting endpoints


‚è±Ô∏è HOURLY TASK PLAN (Est. ~40‚Äì50 hours total)
Time Block Task
Hour 1‚Äì3 Setup project structure, anchor config, WZN token metadata
Hour 4‚Äì6 Implement BurnPass (burn logic, PDA write, lock WZN)
Hour 7‚Äì9 Game access check logic
Hour 10‚Äì14 ScoreTracker basic setup (record wins/slagen)
Hour 15‚Äì18 Setup PrizeVault (accept tokens, queue rewards)
Hour 19‚Äì25 DAO voting system (create/vote/resolve)
Hour 26‚Äì30 Hook in reward distribution and burn vault logic
Hour 31‚Äì34 Emergency recovery logic
Hour 35‚Äì40 Write tests (unit tests for burn, vote, payout)
Hour 41‚Äì50 Frontend integration + deploy to devnet + test end-to-end


‚úÖ Deployment Notes
Use Anchor framework (Rust) for Solana contract development


Deploy to Devnet first, then Mainnet once tested


Try to stay under 3 SOL deployment budget (compact contracts)


Use user-pays-fees model (no central fee wallet)


Would you like me to prepare:


üìÇ A ZIP with smart contract stubs + Anchor boilerplate?


üßæ A visual diagram of the contract interactions?


üìë JSON for DAO voting configs (quorum %, delays)?


üß† Add pseudocode for each module?


Just say the word ‚Äî I can also generate a full Anchor project folder with placeholder code if that helps him prototype faster.
Stanislav Uzunchev 12:52 AM

I'll keep you posted on how far we are.
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 12:55 AM

thanks that is cool we need good communication if we want to round this in 4 - 5 days

you still fine with this approach

the front end developer can likely do it in that time to all

he has worked two ten hour days

by chatgpt given so ilikely a bit less

but if we have it working in under a week we can see really fast if all is good and test nicely and not get in an idea creep
Stanislav Uzunchev 12:58 AM

I hope we can do it in under a week, but we'll see.
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 12:58 AM

yeah it would be cool if we can make it into a sprint

then we can be proud of ourselves üôÇ and can start doing the fun stuff to besides only coding üòâ

i'll let you work on it now thanks
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 12:59 AM

oh i'll make a room tomorrow for you to talk to the other coder
Favorited

he will be done likely in 3 - 4 days with all front end stuff
Stanislav Uzunchev 1:00 AM

oke
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 5:03 PM

hi

how is it going did you guys manage to begin üôÇ

from after tomorrow the other coder could start using smartcontract things i can give him other tasks though optional ones but then we wait for smartcontracts to finish it fast as mvp. But i already have ideas how to expand on it now

so he can do a few more things

but we cannot wait a full week üòâ
Stanislav Uzunchev 5:08 PM

I see, the other one said he's going to the hospital today and then he'll come back and start. I'm still working for him right now, I think he'll be here in 3 hours.

I work, I had to change some things in the contract after the logic changed yesterday
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 5:09 PM

i understand i asked for a total change

i wont be doing that again hopefully if somethign is changed it will be small

Stanislav Uzunchev 4:48 AM

Okay
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 4:53 AM

i will look for a backup to in case you cannot start today i will keep the line open and you can stay on the project but someone has to start working on the contracts else we wont make the sprint

i have one other guy out of all them i was interested in i'll contact him to

in case you cannot find enough time then he can start and you can later follow up and or work on other parts of the project until we need new updates on smartcontracts

one more thing chat gpt forgot

Smart Contract Addition (1‚Äì2 hours)
Add a fee_mode flag stored in a config PDA (e.g., 0 = user-pays, 1 = project-pays)


When executing functions (like burn_for_pass()), the contract checks:


If fee_mode == 1, it uses a pre-approved fee payer (wallet signed by dev/founder)


If fee_mode == 0, the user signs and pays


üîê You will need to pre-sign or whitelist your project wallet as an accepted fee_payer in Anchor config.

i pay for taxes for now but when it gets to expensive i can let users pay üôÇ

solana taxes
KRISTOF VAN ROOY 6:05 AM

for failsafe vote you can do 15% or 35% as option

we need more if we got whales holding the largest amounts

then we might not have enoguh for players
Stanislav Uzunchev 3:06 PM

oke, im rest now

ChatGPT said:

Here‚Äôs a concise message you can send to your new developer on Discord or any chat:

Hey! Here's a quick overview of the project we're building:

We're developing a Solana-based game that uses a burn-to-play mechanic with a token called WZN. Players burn tokens to join matches, and the winner gets rewarded ‚Äî all trustlessly, on-chain.

There‚Äôs also a staking system where users lock WZN to earn APY (around 4%), and this staking unlocks their ability to play. We also have a DAO vault, so governance controls the treasury and rewards. If the DAO goes inactive, a backup team multisig can take over temporarily.

The stack is:

    Solana + Anchor for smart contracts (Rust)

    React + TypeScript for frontend

    Docker for local dev

    Potential use of Switchboard VRF, Metaplex, and other tools later

Let me know if you're in ‚Äî I‚Äôll get you access to the repo and tasks.

Let me know if you want a longer technical onboarding message too.

Sure. Here's a summary of the 4 smart contracts/modules you uploaded, in English:
üß† Smart Contracts Overview

    ame_contract.rs

        Main logic for the game or token operations.

        Likely handles burn-to-play, reward distribution, and game-specific flows.

    recovery_vault.rs

        A recovery mechanism for users who lose access or need emergency retrieval.

        Could include a backup voting or multisig process to restore lost funds.

    staking_pool.rs

        Manages staking of WZN tokens.

        Includes 4% APY reward distribution and quota unlocking mechanism per week.

        Core to the "Stake-to-Play" system (you must stake to receive play quota).

    vault_utils.rs

        Utility functions shared across vault-related contracts.

        Likely handles signer seeds, secure transfers, and access control logic.

If you're onboarding a developer, you can just say:

    "We currently have 4 smart contract modules: the main AME contract, a staking pool with APY and play quota, a recovery vault system for emergency token retrieval, and a utility module for vault operations. The system is built with Anchor and runs on Solana Devnet."

Let me know if you want a full README or diagram too.

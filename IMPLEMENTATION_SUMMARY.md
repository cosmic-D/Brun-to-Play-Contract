## 🔧 Core Features Implemented

### 1. Game Management System
- **Burn-to-Play**: Players burn WZN tokens to participate in games
- **Weekly Quota System**: Staking rewards unlock limited weekly plays
- **Player State Tracking**: Comprehensive player data management
- **Game Statistics**: Total burned tokens and game metrics

### 2. Staking Pool with 4% APY
- **Token Staking**: Players can stake WZN tokens
- **Weekly Rewards**: ~0.0769% weekly (4% APY / 52 weeks)
- **Reward Distribution**: Automatic weekly reward calculations
- **Permissioned Withdrawals**: DAO approval required for withdrawals

### 3. Secure Vault System
- **PDA-Based Security**: All vaults use program-derived addresses
- **Recovery Vault**: Emergency fund storage with backup access
- **Multiple Vaults**: Separate vaults for staking, rewards, and game fees
- **Access Control**: Strict authorization for all vault operations

### 4. Governance & Recovery
- **DAO Control**: Primary governance mechanism
- **Backup Multisig**: 3-member emergency team
- **Emergency Recovery**: Automatic activation after 6 months of DAO inactivity
- **Slashing Mechanism**: Penalty system for malicious behavior

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Account Structures

#### GameState
```rust
pub struct GameState {
    pub bump: u8,
    pub authority: Pubkey,           // DAO authority
    pub backup_team: [Pubkey; 3],    // 3-member backup multisig
    pub wzn_mint: Pubkey,            // WZN token mint
    pub weekly_quota: u32,           // Weekly play quota
    pub total_burned: u64,           // Total tokens burned
    pub last_weekly_reset: i64,      // Last weekly reset timestamp
    pub is_initialized: bool,        // Initialization flag
    pub emergency_mode: bool,        // Emergency mode flag
    pub emergency_threshold: u64,    // Emergency threshold
    pub last_dao_activity: i64,      // Last DAO activity timestamp
}
```

#### StakingPool
```rust
pub struct StakingPool {
    pub bump: u8,
    pub total_staked: u64,           // Total staked tokens
    pub total_rewards_distributed: u64, // Total rewards distributed
    pub last_distribution: i64,      // Last distribution timestamp
    pub apy_rate: u64,               // Annual percentage yield
    pub minimum_stake: u64,          // Minimum stake amount
    pub is_initialized: bool,        // Initialization flag
}
```

#### PlayerState
```rust
pub struct PlayerState {
    pub bump: u8,
    pub player: Pubkey,              // Player public key
    pub total_staked: u64,           // Player's total stake
    pub total_rewards_claimed: u64,  // Total rewards claimed
    pub last_claim_time: i64,        // Last claim timestamp
    pub weekly_plays_used: u32,      // Plays used this week
    pub last_weekly_reset: i64,      // Last weekly reset
    pub is_slashed: bool,            // Slashing status
    pub slash_amount: u64,           // Amount slashed
}
```

### PDA Seeds
- `game_state`: Global game state
- `staking_pool`: Staking pool management
- `recovery_vault`: Emergency vault
- `player_state`: Player-specific data
- `player_quota`: Weekly quota tracking
- `staking_vault`: Staked token storage
- `reward_vault`: Reward distribution
- `game_vault`: Game fee collection

## 🚀 Instructions Implemented

### Game Management
1. **initialize_game**: Initialize game with DAO authority and backup team
2. **burn_to_play**: Burn WZN tokens to play a game
3. **use_quota_play**: Use weekly quota for free play

### Staking Management
4. **initialize_staking_pool**: Initialize staking pool
5. **stake_tokens**: Stake WZN tokens to earn rewards
6. **claim_rewards**: Claim weekly staking rewards
7. **withdraw_stake**: Withdraw staked tokens (DAO approval required)

### Vault Management
8. **initialize_vault**: Initialize recovery vault
9. **deposit_to_vault**: Deposit tokens to recovery vault
10. **dao_withdraw**: DAO-controlled withdrawals
11. **backup_withdraw**: Emergency withdrawals by backup team

### Governance
12. **update_governance**: Update DAO authority
13. **update_backup_team**: Update backup team members
14. **slash_stake**: Slash player stakes for violations

## 🔐 Security Features

### Access Control
- **PDA Authorities**: All critical operations use program-derived addresses
- **DAO Governance**: Primary control mechanism for major operations
- **Backup Recovery**: Emergency access for backup team after inactivity
- **Slashing**: Penalty mechanism for malicious behavior

### Emergency Recovery Logic
```rust
// Check emergency conditions
let dao_inactive = clock.unix_timestamp - game_state.last_dao_activity > WEEKLY_SECONDS * 26; // 6 months
let low_balance = recovery_vault.total_deposited - recovery_vault.total_withdrawn < recovery_vault.backup_threshold;

require!(dao_inactive || low_balance, GameError::NotEmergencyState);
```

### Tokenomics Implementation
- **4% APY**: Weekly reward calculation: `(staked_amount * 4 * 100 / 52) / 10000`
- **Burn Tracking**: All burns tracked on-chain in `total_burned`
- **Quota System**: Weekly resets prevent farming/spamming
- **Non-custodial**: Users maintain control until tokens are used

## 🧪 Testing Framework

The project includes a comprehensive test suite covering:
- Game initialization and configuration
- Staking and reward mechanisms
- Burn-to-play functionality
- Vault security and recovery
- Governance operations
- Emergency scenarios

## 📊 Key Constants

```rust
pub const WEEKLY_SECONDS: i64 = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60;        // 7 days
pub const ANNUAL_REWARD_RATE: u64 = 4;                   // 4% APY
pub const WEEKLY_REWARD_RATE: u64 = 4 * 100 / 52;        // ~0.0769% weekly
pub const MINIMUM_STAKE_AMOUNT: u64 = 1_000_000;         // 1 WZN (6 decimals)
pub const MAX_SLASH_PERCENTAGE: u64 = 50;                // 50% max slashing
```

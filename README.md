# WZN Burn-to-Play Game on Solana

A crypto-native multiplayer card game built on Solana where players stake WZN tokens to unlock weekly play quotas. The system features a burn mechanism, staking rewards, and a recovery vault, all governed by a DAO with backup voting logic.

## üéÆ Game Overview

The WZN Burn-to-Play Game is designed with the following core principles:

- **Burn-to-Play**: Players must burn WZN tokens to participate in games
- **Staking Rewards**: Players earn ~4% APY by staking WZN tokens
- **Weekly Quotas**: Staking rewards unlock limited weekly play quotas
- **Non-custodial**: Users maintain control of their funds until used
- **DAO Governance**: Community-driven governance with backup recovery

## üìã Instructions

### Game Management

- `initialize_game`: Initialize the game with DAO authority and backup team
- `burn_to_play`: Burn WZN tokens to play a game
- `use_quota_play`: Use weekly quota for free play

### Staking Management

- `initialize_staking_pool`: Initialize the staking pool
- `stake_tokens`: Stake WZN tokens to earn rewards
- `claim_rewards`: Claim weekly staking rewards
- `withdraw_stake`: Withdraw staked tokens (DAO approval required)

### Vault Management

- `initialize_vault`: Initialize the recovery vault
- `deposit_to_vault`: Deposit tokens to the recovery vault
- `dao_withdraw`: DAO-controlled withdrawals
- `backup_withdraw`: Emergency withdrawals by backup team

### Governance

- `update_governance`: Update DAO authority
- `update_backup_team`: Update backup team members
- `slash_stake`: Slash player stakes for violations

## üîê Security Features

### Access Control

- **PDA Authorities**: All critical operations use program-derived addresses
- **DAO Governance**: Primary control mechanism for major operations
- **Backup Recovery**: Emergency access for backup team after inactivity
- **Slashing**: Penalty mechanism for malicious behavior

### Emergency Recovery

The system includes a sophisticated recovery mechanism:

1. **DAO Inactivity**: If DAO doesn't interact for 6 months
2. **Low Balance**: If vault balance drops below threshold
3. **Backup Access**: 3-member multisig can access emergency funds
4. **Limited Withdrawal**: Emergency withdrawals capped at 25% of vault

## üí∞ Tokenomics

### Staking Rewards

- **APY**: 4% annual yield
- **Distribution**: Weekly rewards to player quota accounts
- **Usage**: Rewards can only be used for gameplay, not withdrawn

### Burn Mechanism

- **Game Cost**: Variable burn amount per game
- **Tracking**: All burns tracked on-chain
- **Deflationary**: Reduces total WZN supply

### Quota System

- **Weekly Reset**: Quotas reset every 7 days
- **Staking-Based**: Quota size based on staked amount
- **Anti-Farming**: Prevents spam and farming
